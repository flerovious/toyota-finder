## About
Toyota Finder is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that leverages machine learning techniques to help users find their dream Toyota vehicle based on their personal preferences and profile. Using a model powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5, the app dynamically scores user inputs across multiple dimensions to recommend the most suitable Toyota cars.

## Features
- **Personalized Scoring:** Users can input details about their risk tolerance, social preferences, curiosity, moral viewpoints, and safety concerns, which are then scored to match car profiles.
- **Advanced Matching Algorithm:** Utilizes k-nearest neighbors (kNN) to find cars that best match the userâ€™s profile, based on normalized dataset scores.
- **Interactive UI:** Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their preferences and receive immediate car recommendations.

## Installation

To set up the Toyota Finder, follow these steps. The project was developed using Python 3.11.9.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/flerovious/toyota-finder.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```
   cd toyota-finder
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit application:**
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

After launching the app, follow these steps:

1. **Fill out the questionnaire** on the homepage. Each question correlates with a specific scoring metric used to find your dream Toyota.

2. **Submit your responses** by clicking the 'Submit' button at the end of the form.

3. **View your recommendations.** The app will display the top three Toyota vehicles that match your preferences, along with a fun, personalized one-liner generated by the AI.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Main programming language used.
- **Streamlit:** For creating the web application.
- **OpenAI's GPT-3.5:** Used for scoring user inputs and generating personalized one-liners.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For performing k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Python-dotenv:** For managing environment variables.

## Data

The dataset used `data.csv` includes various attributes of Toyota cars, which are normalized and used for the kNN algorithm. This dataset has been curated by hand by Daniel our car expert.

## Debug Mode

The application includes a DEBUG_MODE toggle which, when enabled, uses predefined inputs for testing and demonstration purposes. This helps in evaluating the system without manually entering data each time.
